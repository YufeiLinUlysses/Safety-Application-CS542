python code specification:

Use tab instead of space;

Add the type of variable before or after the variable name.
Example:
Integer:   iNum, iCount, iGrade
object: oTree, oNode
float: fDiff
list: remainNumList
set: studentSet.
dict: url2TxtDict


The file name should always be small capital: file_name

Camel-Case for other variables.

The function name should start with big capital letter: def Find()
def Get()

The variables should start with small capital letter: iNum.

I personally would add m_ for all class' member, like: self.m_iBirthday. 

The comment for the function should be: input, output, describe for function.
