# Safety-Application-CS542

## Python code specification:

### Use tab instead of space;

### Variable Name:
Add the type of variable before or after the variable name.
The variables should start with small capital letter: iNum.
Camel-Case for other variables.
I personally would add m_ for all class' member, like: self.m_iBirthday. 
Example:
Integer:   iNum, iCount, iGrade
float: fDiff
list: remainNumList
set: studentSet.
dict: url2TxtDict
object: oTree, oNode

### Function Name:
The comment for the function should be: input, output, describe for function.
The function name should start with big capital letter: 
def Find()
def Get()

### File:
The file name should always be small capital: file_name
